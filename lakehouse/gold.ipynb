    "#Gold Layer - Business-Ready Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of This Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gold layer represents the final, business-consumable data model in the Lakehouse architecture. It is designed to serve analytics, reporting, and decision-making needs by presenting clean, integrated, and standardized datasets in a star schema format.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Bronze and Silver layers focus on ingestion and data quality, the Gold layer focuses on clarity, usability, and alignment with how the business thinks about data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What This Layer Contains**\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer exposes three logical views, each built from curated Silver-layer data:\n",
    "- Customer Dimension (dim_customers): Provides a unified customer profile by combining CRM and ERP data, resolving conflicts between systems, and standardizing key attributes such as country, gender, and marital status.\n",
    "- Product Dimension (dim_products): Represents the current, active product catalog with consistent categorization, product hierarchy, and cost attributes. Historical product records are intentionally excluded to keep reporting simple and relevant.\n",
    "- Sales Fact (fact_sales): Captures transactional sales data at the order-line level, linking each sale to its corresponding customer and product using surrogate keys.\n",
    "Together, these views form a star schema, which is a widely used design pattern for Business Intelligence and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Principles Applied**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business-first modeling: Tables are structured around business entities (Customers, Products, Sales), not source-system tables.\n",
    "- Single source of truth: All reporting and dashboards are built on top of these Gold views to ensure consistency.\n",
    "- Separation of concerns:\n",
    "    - Data cleaning and standardization happen in the Silver layer\n",
    "    - Business-ready modeling happens here\n",
    "    - Aggregations and KPIs are handled in the analytics or reporting layer (e.g., Power BI)\n",
    "- Views instead of physical tables: Using views keeps the Gold layer lightweight, always up to date, and easy to evolve as business requirements change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intended Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gold layer is intended to be:\n",
    "- Consumed directly by BI tools such as Power BI\n",
    "- Used by analysts and business users without needing to understand raw source systems\n",
    "- Extended in the future if performance or scale requires materialization\n",
    "This layer bridges the gap between clean data and actionable insights, making it the foundation for dashboards, KPIs, and strategic analysis.\n",

    "# Gold Reporting Views – Business Analytics Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "This notebook defines **business-facing reporting views** built on top of the Gold star schema.\n",
    "These views translate raw facts and dimensions into **decision-ready datasets** by applying\n",
    "business logic, segmentation rules, and analytical KPIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this layer exists\n",
    "While the Gold layer provides clean **facts and dimensions**, business users rarely consume\n",
    "raw tables directly. They need:\n",
    "- Pre-defined KPIs\n",
    "- Consistent segmentation logic\n",
    "- Customer and product performance summaries\n",
    "- Metrics that align with business questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This layer acts as a **semantic / analytical layer**, ensuring that:\n",
    "- Business rules are centralized and reusable\n",
    "- KPI definitions remain consistent across reports\n",
    "- Power BI dashboards stay lightweight and easy to maintain\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this layer includes\n",
    "- Customer-level analytical view (`gold.report_customers`)\n",
    "- Product-level analytical view (`gold.report_products`)\n",
    "- Metrics such as:\n",
    "  - Recency\n",
    "  - Lifespan\n",
    "  - Average Order Value / Revenue\n",
    "  - Monthly Spend / Revenue\n",
    "  - Customer and product segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this layer does NOT do\n",
    "- No raw data cleansing (handled in Silver)\n",
    "- No heavy aggregations for storage optimization\n",
    "- No visualization logic (handled in Power BI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Power BI connects directly to these views to enable **self-service analytics** while preserving\n",
    "business logic integrity.\n"
